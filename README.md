# TypedPreferences
A simple library to make the use of Android's ```SharedPreferences``` easier while keeping it type safe. This library was designed to be used with a Dependency Injection Framework like **Dagger 2** and **Lombok** for boilerplate code generation in mind. If you have never used one of those tools I highly recommend looking into them before building your new app.

# How to use
Have a look at the demo app (```app```  module) for a complete sample.
The sample app uses **Dagger 2** to inject the ```PreferenceHandler``` into the activity and fragment because this is the recommended way to use this library.


Detailed examples will follow soon.
